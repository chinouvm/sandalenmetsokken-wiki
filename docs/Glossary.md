## GPL

GPL (general purpose programming language) is a language used for building software in a variety of domains.

Common GPL's:

- C++
- Python
- C
- Java

Source : [GPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_programming_language)

## object-oriented programming

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a type of programming based around the concept of a "Object".

Objects are instances of a Class. A class can contain data in often in attributes or properties and functions known as methods.

Common OOP languages:

- C++
- Python
- C#
- Java

## generic programming

Generic programming allows algorithms to be written in a particular syntax where the algorithms are adaptive but can still be compiled by the compiler.

!!! example

    Using generic programming, a sorting algorithm doesn't have to worry about exactly what data type it sorts, only how it does it.

Common languages that support generic programming:

- C++
- Java

## functional programming

In functional programming, information processing is expressed in the form of functions, similar to mathematical functions.

With this style, changes to variables outside the function and the storage of program state and modifiable variables should be avoided ([Side effects](#side-effects)).

Common languages that support functional programming:

- C++
- Haskell
- APL

!!! note

    C++ `does not support all` of the functional programming features (By default).
    However with the C++ you can add functions to do so.

## Side effects

In CS an operation, function or expression is said to have a side effect if it modifies some state variable value outside its local environment.

This means that a function not only returns a value, but also modifies some variable. Thus not ideal for programming. Since this makes a program less predictable.

In [functional programming](#functional-programming) you see that changing variables is avoided as much as possible.
