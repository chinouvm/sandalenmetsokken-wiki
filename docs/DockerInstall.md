Step 2: The Docker menu (:fontawesome-brands-docker:) displays the Docker Subscription Service Agreement window. It includes a change to the terms of use for Docker Desktop.

**Here’s a summary of the key changes:**

- Our Docker Subscription Service Agreement includes a change to the terms of use for Docker Desktop
- It remains free for small businesses (fewer than 250 employees AND less than $10 million in annual revenue), personal use, education, and non-commercial open source projects.
- It requires a paid subscription for professional use in larger enterprises.
- The effective date of these terms is August 31, 2021.
- The existing Docker Free subscription has been renamed Docker Personal and we have introduced a Docker Business subscription .
- The Docker Pro, Team, and Business subscriptions include commercial use of Docker Desktop.

Step 3: Click the checkbox to indicate that you accept the updated terms and then click Accept to continue. Docker Desktop starts after you accept the terms.

???+ warning "Important"

    If you do not agree to the updated terms, the Docker Desktop application will close and you can no longer run Docker Desktop on your machine. You can choose to accept the terms at a later date by opening Docker Desktop.

### Quick Start Guide

When the initialization is complete, Docker Desktop launches the Quick Start Guide. This tutorial includes a simple exercise to build an example Docker image, run it as a container, push and save the image to Docker Hub.

To run the Quick Start Guide on demand, right-click the Docker icon in the Notifications area (or System tray) to open the Docker Desktop menu and then select Quick Start Guide.

## **Linux Installation :fontawesome-brands-linux:**

This guide contains the most common steps to install Docker on Linux. All these steps can be found on the Docker Website.

!!! info "Download Docker Desktop for Linux packages"

    [DEB](https://desktop.docker.com/linux/main/amd64/docker-desktop-4.10.1-amd64.deb?utm_source=docker&utm_medium=webreferral&utm_campaign=docs-driven-download-linux-amd64){ .md-button .md-button--primary }
    [RPM](https://desktop.docker.com/linux/main/amd64/docker-desktop-4.10.1-x86_64.rpm?utm_source=docker&utm_medium=webreferral&utm_campaign=docs-driven-download-linux-amd64){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

*For checksums, see [*Release notes*](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/release-notes/)*

### System requirements

To install Docker Desktop successfully, your Linux host must meet the following requirements:

- 64-bit kernel and CPU support for virtualization

- KVM virtualization support. Follow the KVM virtualization support instructions to check if the KVM kernel modules are enabled and how to provide access to the kvm device.

- QEMU must be version 5.2 or newer. We recommend upgrading to the latest version.

- systemd init system.

- Gnome or KDE Desktop environment. -For many Linux distros, the Gnome environment does not support tray icons. To add support for tray icons, you need to install a Gnome extension. For example, AppIndicator).

- At least 4 GB of RAM.

Docker Desktop for Linux runs a Virtual Machine (VM). For more information on why, see [Why Docker Desktop for Linux runs a VM.](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/#why-docker-desktop-for-linux-runs-a-vm)

???+ info "Note"

     Docker does not provide support for running Docker Desktop in nested virtualization scenarios. We recommend that you run Docker Desktop for Linux natively on supported distributions.

### Supported platforms

Docker provides `.deb` and `.rpm` packages from the following Linux distributions and architectures:

| **Platform**                                              | **x86_64 /amd64**     |

## **Mac Installation :material-apple:**

!!! warning "Update to the Docker Desktop terms"

    Commercial use of Docker Desktop in larger enterprises (more than 250 employees OR more than $10 million USD in annual revenue) now requires a paid subscription.

This guide contains the most common steps to install Docker on Mac. All these steps can be found on the Docker Website.

!!! info "Download Docker Desktop for Mac"

      [Mac with Intel chip](https://desktop.docker.com/mac/main/amd64/Docker.dmg?utm_source=docker&utm_medium=webreferral&utm_campaign=docs-driven-download-mac-amd64){ .md-button .md-button--primary }
      [Mac with Apple Silicon](https://desktop.docker.com/mac/main/arm64/Docker.dmg?utm_source=docker&utm_medium=webreferral&utm_campaign=docs-driven-download-mac-arm64){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

### System requirements

Your Mac must meet the following requirements to install Docker Desktop successfully.

=== "Mac with Intel chip"

    #### Mac with Intel chip
    - **macOS must be version 10.15 or newer. That is, Catalina, Big Sur, or Monterey. We recommend upgrading to the latest version of macOS.**

      If you experience any issues after upgrading your macOS to version 10.15, you must install the latest version of Docker Desktop to be compatible with this version of macOS.

    !!! info "Note"
        Docker supports Docker Desktop on the most recent versions of macOS. That is, the current release of macOS and the previous two releases. As new major versions of macOS are made generally available, Docker stops supporting the oldest version and supports the newest version of macOS (in addition to the previous two releases). Docker Desktop currently supports macOS Catalina, macOS Big Sur, and macOS Monterey.


    - At least 4 GB of RAM.
    - VirtualBox prior to version 4.3.30 must not be installed as it is not compatible with Docker Desktop.

=== "Mac with Apple Silicon"

    #### Mac with Apple silicon
    Beginning with Docker Desktop 4.3.0, we have removed the hard requirement to install Rosetta 2. There are a few optional command line tools that still require Rosetta 2 when using Darwin/AMD64. See the [Known issues section](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/apple-silicon/#known-issues). However, to get the best experience, we recommend that you install Rosetta 2. To install Rosetta 2 manually from the command line, run the following command:

    ```shell
    $ softwareupdate --install-rosetta
    ```

    For more information, see [Docker Desktop for Apple silicon.](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/apple-silicon/)

### Install and run Docker Desktop on Mac

#### Install interactively

Step 1: Double-click `Docker.dmg` to open the installer, then drag the Docker icon to the Applications folder.

Step 2: Double-click `Docker.app` in the Applications folder to start Docker. In the example below, the Applications folder is in “grid” view mode.

Step 3: The Docker menu (:fontawesome-brands-docker:) displays the Docker Subscription Service Agreement window. It includes a change to the terms of use for Docker Desktop.

_Here’s a summary of the key changes:_

- Our Docker Subscription Service Agreement includes a change to the terms of use for Docker Desktop
- It remains free for small businesses (fewer than 250 employees AND less than $10 million in annual revenue), personal use, education, and non-commercial open source projects.
- It requires a paid subscription for professional use in larger enterprises.
- The effective date of these terms is August 31, 2021.
- The existing Docker Free subscription has been renamed Docker Personal and we have introduced a Docker Business subscription .
- The Docker Pro, Team, and Business subscriptions include commercial use of Docker Desktop.

Step 4: Click the checkbox to indicate that you accept the updated terms and then click **Accept** to continue. Docker Desktop starts after you accept the terms.

???+ warning "Important"

    If you do not agree to the terms, the Docker Desktop application will close and you can no longer run Docker Desktop on your machine. You can choose to accept the terms at a later date by opening Docker Desktop.

For more information, see [Docker Desktop License Agreement](https://docs.docker.com/subscription/#docker-desktop-license-agreement). We recommend that you also read the [Blog](https://www.docker.com/blog/updating-product-subscriptions/) and [FAQs](https://www.docker.com/pricing/faq) to learn how companies using Docker Desktop may be affected.

#### Install from the command line

After downloading `Docker.dmg`, run the following commands in a terminal to install Docker Desktop in the Applications folder:

```shell
 $ sudo hdiutil attach Docker.dmg
 $ sudo /Volumes/Docker/Docker.app/Contents/MacOS/install
 $ sudo hdiutil detach /Volumes/Docker
```

The `install` command accepts the following flags:

- `--accept-license`: accepts the [Docker Subscription Service Agreement](https://www.docker.com/legal/docker-subscription-service-agreement) now, rather than requiring it to be accepted when the application is first run
- `--allowed-org=<org name>`: requires the user to sign in and be part of the specified Docker Hub organization when running the application
